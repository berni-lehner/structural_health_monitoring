Sandwich Face Layer Debonding Detection and Size Estimation
by Machine Learning-based evaluation of Electromechanical

## Abstract
The present research proposes a two-step physics- and machine learning (ML)-based electromechanical impedance (EMI) measurement data evaluation approach for sandwich face layer debonding detection and size estimation in structural health monitoring applications.
As a case example, a circular aluminum sandwich panel with idealized face layer debonding is used.
Both, sensor and debonding are located at the center of the sandwich.
Synthetic EMI spectra are generated by a finite element (FE)-based parameter study and used for feature engineering and ML model training and development.
Calibration of the real-world EMI measurement data is shown to overcome the FE-model simplifications, enabling their evaluation by the found synthetic data-based features and models.
Data preprocessing and ML models are validated by unseen real-world EMI measurement data collected in laboratory environment.
The best detection and size estimation performances were found for a One-class Support Vector Machine and a K-Nearest Neighbor model, respectively, which clearly show reliable identification of relevant debonding sizes.
Furthermore, the approach is shown to be robust against unknown artificial disturbances and outperforms a previous method for debonding size estimation.
The data and code used in this study are provided in their entirety to enhance comprehensibility and encourage future research.

## Reproducing Results <a name="reproduction"></a>
The notebooks contain a Colab badge ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg), which can be clicked to open a Colab runtime to reproduce the results without the need to locally install anything.
Notice, that we *intentionally* shut down the notebook in Colab after the required packages and libraries are installed.
It is necessary to run the notebook again to finish up the installation, and this is not a bug!
More information about Colab can be found here: [www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/index.htm).
