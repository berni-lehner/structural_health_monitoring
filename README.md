Sandwich Face Layer Debonding Detection and Size Estimation
by Machine Learning-based evaluation of Electromechanical
Impedance Measurements, Sensors, 2023

## Abstract
The present research proposes a two-step physics- and machine learning (ML)-based electromechanical impedance (EMI) measurement data evaluation approach for sandwich face layer debonding detection and size estimation in structural health monitoring applications.
As a case example, a circular aluminum sandwich panel with idealized face layer debonding is used.
Both, sensor and debonding are located at the center of the sandwich.
Synthetic EMI spectra are generated by a finite element (FE)-based parameter study and used for feature engineering and ML model training and development.
Calibration of the real-world EMI measurement data is shown to overcome the FE-model simplifications, enabling their evaluation by the found synthetic data-based features and models.
Data preprocessing and ML models are validated by unseen real-world EMI measurement data collected in laboratory environment.
The best detection and size estimation performances were found for a One-class Support Vector Machine and a K-Nearest Neighbor model, respectively, which clearly show reliable identification of relevant debonding sizes.
Furthermore, the approach is shown to be robust against unknown artificial disturbances and outperforms a previous method for debonding size estimation.
The data and code used in this study are provided in their entirety to enhance comprehensibility and encourage future research.
